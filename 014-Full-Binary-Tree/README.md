![](image.png)

* A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
* It is also known as **a proper binary tree**.

## Properties

* The number of leaves is `i + 1`.
* The total number of nodes is `2i + 1`.
* The number of internal nodes is `(n – 1) / 2`.
* The number of leaves is `(n + 1) / 2`.
* The total number of nodes is `2l – 1`.
* The number of internal nodes is `l – 1`.
* The number of leaves is at most `2<sup>λ - 1</sup>`.

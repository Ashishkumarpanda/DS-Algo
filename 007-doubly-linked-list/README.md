![](image.png)

* It is a 2-way linked list.
* operations

  * traverse
    * forward
    * backward
  * insert
  * delete
* complexity


| Doubly Linked List Complexity | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
| - | - | - |
| **Insertion Operation** | O(1) or O(n) | O(1) |
| **Deletion Operation** | O(1) | O(1) |

* applications
  * Redo and undo functionality in software.
  * Forward and backward navigation in browsers.
  * For navigation systems where forward and backward navigation is required.

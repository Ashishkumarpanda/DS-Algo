# Circular Singly Linked List

![](image.png)

* A circular linked list is a type of [linked list](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list) in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle.
* operations
  * insertion
  * deletion
* complexity


| Circular Linked List Complexity | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
| - | - | - |
| **Insertion Operation** | O(1) or O(n) | O(1) |
| **Deletion Operation** | O(1) | O(1) |

* advantages
  * The NULL assignment is not required because a node always points to another node.
  * The starting point can be set to any node.
  * Traversal from the first node to the last node is quick.
* applications
  * It is used in multiplayer games to give a chance to each player to play the game.
  * Multiple running applications can be placed in a circular linked list on an operating system. The os keeps on iterating over these applications.

# Singly Linked List

![](image.png)

* A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node store the **data** and the **address** of the next node.
* operations

  * **Traversal** - access each element of the linked list
  * **Insertion** - adds a new element
  * **Deletion** - removes the existing elements
* time complexity


|   | Worst case | Average Case |
| - | - | - |
| **Search** | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Insert** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Deletion** | O(1) | O(1) |

* Space Complexity: `O(n)`
* applications

  * Dynamic memory allocation
  * Implemented in stack and queue
  * In **undo** functionality of softwares
  * Hash tables, Graphs
